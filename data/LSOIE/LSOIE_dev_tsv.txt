Triples: <workers|get|a ten percent increase in earnings>;<a city|doubled|in size>;<Glaeser|Discussing|the benefits of proximity>;
Sentence: Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city , so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in .
Triples: <bigger cities|pay|for equal productivity>;<Glaeser|furthers|his argument>;<workers|become|more productive>;
Sentence: The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase , because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city .

Triples: <the laws of physics|change|with time itself>;
Sentence: Philosophically this can be stated as `` nothing depends on time per se '' .
Triples: <nothing|depends|on time>;
Sentence: Conversely , systems which are not invariant under shifts in time -LRB- an example , systems with time dependent potential energy -RRB- do not exhibit conservation of energy -- unless we consider them to exchange energy with another , external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again .
Triples: <the theory of the enlarged system|becomes|time invariant>;
Sentence: Since any time-varying system can be embedded within a larger time-invariant system -LRB- with the exception of the universe -RRB- , conservation can always be recovered by a suitable re-definition of what energy is and extending the scope of your system .
